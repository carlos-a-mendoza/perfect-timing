Project Title: Perfect Timing

Tech Stack Used:
-React.js
-Node.js
-MUI
-MySQL

Project Description:

Event Planning made easier. This allows users to "sync" (share calendar data only checks if there is an event) their calendars with friends or colleagues to find a common day that you and the others have nothing planned. Essentially a day where you are all available. This eliminates the time consuming issue of waiting on someone's availability, communication obstacles, etc. 
Given that it is a digital planner, this can be carried everywhere with you. You can simply update your schedule by adding an event and when submitted will apply a badge on your calendar. Upon loading onto the landing page, the user will see upcoming events which will act as a reminder to the user. 
Given that it is user data driven. Seed Data are essential to interact with the site if there are minimal users. Check the backend code and refer to migrations and see what data are required for the seed data if you would like to add more.  

How to Install and Run the Project:

-once the code is obtained, be sure to npm install the necessary dependencies
-this project is user data driven meaning it requires user inputs 

API References:
- BackEnd API created through MySQL

Lessons Learned:
- Reading MUI documentation and using a component from them is definitely time consuming but exposes you to other tricks that you apply on future projects
- Styling these MUI components are quite difficult especially when trying to use SASS 

Next Steps:
- Want to check the availability by hours and time of day
- Apply a privacy filter that would hide your icon from users that you are not connected with 
- Apply dark mode
- Customization of different themes
- Fix any bugs or errors
